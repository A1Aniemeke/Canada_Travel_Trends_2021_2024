## Introduction

Curious about how international travel has shifted over time, I explored the volume and nature of travellers entering or returning to Canada. With fluctuating travel regulations, pandemic recovery, and changing mobility trends, this analysis aims to answer:

- How have **traveller volumes** changed from 2021 to 2024?
- Which **provinces** receive the most international travellers?
- What **types of travellers** are most common, and how do they enter the country?

Using official data from **Statistics Canada**, this project offers a breakdown of travel trends by **province, travel type, and traveller characteristics**.

The insights are valuable for **policymakers**, **transportation authorities**, and **businesses** seeking to better understand Canada's evolving travel landscape.



## Overview

This project analyzes data from **Statistics Canada** on international travellers entering or returning to Canada between **2021 and 2024**. The dataset captures entries by **province**, **mode of transportation** (air, land, water), **traveller type** (excursionists vs tourists), and **traveller characteristics** (e.g., Canadian residents returning, U.S. residents, others).

The analysis provides insights into:

- Monthly travel patterns and recovery trends post-2020
- Provincial differences in travel volume
- Distribution of traveller types and their modes of entry
- Key traveller demographics entering Canada
