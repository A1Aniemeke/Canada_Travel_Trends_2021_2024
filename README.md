## Introduction  
As part of my ongoing analytics journey, I explored international travel patterns to and from Canada using official data from **Statistics Canada**.  
This project focuses on identifying how travel has evolved from **2021 to 2024**, analyzing traveller types, modes of transportation, and regional entry patterns.

Key questions explored:
- How has international travel volume changed month-by-month?
- Which provinces receive the highest number of travellers?
- What transportation modes are most commonly used?
- Who are the travellers — tourists or returning residents?

This analysis uses **Python** for data cleaning and transformation, **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for visualizations, and culminates in an **interactive dashboard** created in **Tableau**.
