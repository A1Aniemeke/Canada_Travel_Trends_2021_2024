## Introduction
International travel plays a vital role in shaping Canada’s economy, tourism, and border policies. As I continue my academic journey in Ontario, I became interested in exploring how people enter or return to Canada—and how patterns shift across provinces and traveller types.

This project examines **international traveller movement into Canada from 2021 to 2024** using a dataset from **Statistics Canada**. It focuses on key variables such as **province of entry**, **traveller type** (excursionist vs tourist), and **traveller characteristics** (residency and mode of transportation).

By analyzing trends over time, we aim to identify:
- Which provinces serve as the main points of entry?
- Are certain traveller types more dominant?
- How has the volume of travellers changed post-pandemic?

The insights are valuable for **policymakers**, **transportation authorities**, and **businesses** seeking to better understand Canada's evolving travel landscape.



## Overview

This project analyzes data on **international travellers entering or returning to Canada** from **January 2021 to December 2024**. The dataset, sourced from **Statistics Canada**, provides detailed information on:

- **Geographic Entry Points**: Provinces and territories across Canada
- **Traveller Type**: Excursionists (same-day) vs Tourists (overnight)
- **Traveller Characteristics**: Residency (Canadian, American, others) and transportation mode (air, land, water)
- **Temporal Trends**: Monthly breakdown of travel activity

The aim is to uncover **travel trends**, highlight **provincial entry patterns**, and understand the **mobility of different traveller categories** — helping provide insights that are useful for policymakers, transport agencies, and tourism planning.
