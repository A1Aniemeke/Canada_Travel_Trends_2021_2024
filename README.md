## Introduction  
As part of my ongoing analytics journey, I explored international travel patterns to and from Canada using official data from **Statistics Canada**.  
This project focuses on identifying how travel has evolved from **2021 to 2024**, analyzing traveller types, modes of transportation, and regional entry patterns.

Key questions explored:
- How has international travel volume changed month-by-month?
- Which provinces receive the highest number of travellers?
- What transportation modes are most commonly used?
- Who are the travellers — tourists or returning residents?

This analysis uses **Python** for data cleaning and transformation, **Seaborn & Matplotlib** for visualizations, and culminates in an **interactive dashboard** created in **Tableau**.

## Overview

This project analyzes data on **international travellers entering or returning to Canada** from **January 2021 to December 2024**. The dataset, sourced from **Statistics Canada**, provides detailed information on:

- **Geographic Entry Points**: Provinces and territories across Canada
- **Traveller Type**: Excursionists (same-day) vs Tourists (overnight)
- **Traveller Characteristics**: Residency (Canadian, American, others) and transportation mode (air, land, water)
- **Temporal Trends**: Monthly breakdown of travel activity

The aim is to uncover **travel trends**, highlight **provincial entry patterns**, and understand the **mobility of different traveller categories** — helping provide insights that are useful for policymakers, transport agencies, and tourism planning.
